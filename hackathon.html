	<li>image: <img src="glutenFree2.jpg"></li>
	<li>selling point 1: Throughout there are recipes that use the test kitchenâ€™s all-purpose flour blend, such as bagels, hamburger rolls, brioche, baguettes, and easy-to-make pan pizzas, as well as sweet treats like yeasted doughnuts, blondies, lemon layer cake, and Dutch apple pie.</li>
	<li>selling point 2: Instead of having crumbly, sandy bread you can make bread that has a crumb, springiness AND tastes like real bread.</li>
	<li>selling point 3: All were fantastic! Test Kitchen's recipes are reliable and worth the price.</li>
